# Dr-Coomer-Neopet-GBA-
A port of my Dr Coomer Neopet to the GBA using Butano.

Please don't judge the code too closely, not just is this my first C++ project, but I also had some major struggles with understanding Butano via its very "utilitarian" documentation, alongside certain functions (*cough* *cough* .clear() for vectors) not existing in Visual Studio's intellisense.

## Building
Run the 'make' command in the root directory.

The output should be a .gba file compatible with GBA emulators.

I cannot confirm whether it functions on real GBA hardware as I do not own a GBA or a GBA flash cart, but according to the Butano documentation, it *should work*.
